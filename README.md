## 👋 Introduction

Web Point of Sales is a web-based application program used for retail transactions in places like restaurants, cafes, minimarkets, and more.

This website is built using the PHP programming language and the latest version of the CodeIgniter framework, compatible with PHP versions 5.6 to 7.4. The web interface is designed to be simple and responsive, adjusting to the screen width of the device (computer/mobile phone) being used. The website also includes an admin page for website management and content input, such as news.

The Point of Sales system is designed to provide convenience in managing retail and wholesale businesses, including sales, incoming inventory, and generating reports on income and expenses for easier and faster management.

It is a web-based program, meaning it runs on browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and others, making it easy to use.

#### Suitable for businesses such as:
▪ Supermarkets / Minimarkets / Convenience stores
▪ Computer / Mobile phone / Electronics / Wholesale / Office Supplies / Books / Photocopy shops
▪ Building stores / Ceramics / Household items
▪ Fashion stores / Boutiques / Distros / Bags / Shoes / Sandals / Jewelry / Men and Women Accessories
▪ Furniture stores / Souvenirs / Cakes / Merchandise
▪ Pharmacies / Automotive / Motorcycle Dealers / Showrooms / Employee Cooperatives / Cafes / Restaurants
▪ And other business sectors

Traditional cashier systems require manual monitoring of commodity inventory. However, with a computerized POS system, you don't have to worry about current stock levels. This system can track sales and provide real-time information, keeping your inventory records always up-to-date.

#### Using this program, you can:
1. Analyze sales data to understand how well each item in your store sells, allowing you to adjust the frequency and quantity of purchases needed.
2. Improve billing accuracy.
3. Store sales data records.
